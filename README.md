I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Bonn Graduate School of Economics at the University of Bonn. In my research, I analyze macroeconomic questions connecting evidence on the aggregate level with micro-level data, using structural models. I also work on computational methods for heterogeneous agent models.

* Fundamental Stock Price Cycles
**Abstract** News shocks about higher future capital returns can explain stock price-booms and subsequent -busts in a two-asset, heterogeneous agent New Keynesian model. The portfolio choice between liquid assets (like stocks) and illiquid capital is key, as it allows for a time-varying illiquidity premium. Upon the news, capital-rich households accept to hold more illiquid capital at a lower premium, in anticipation of higher future returns on it. This increases their consumption risk, and causes stock prices to rise. After the boom, capital-rich households trade capital for liquid assets in order to self-insure against idiosyncratic income shocks, which increases the illiquidity premium, and causes stock prices to fall. Novel evidence from survey data on portfolio choices of capital-wealthy households during stock price boom-bust cycles supports the key mechanism of the model.
